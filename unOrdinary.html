I didn&rsquo;t want to spend 5 days in old, crocked up museums or withered castles; sweating buckets in the heat and getting sand stuck in my boxers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My sister didn&rsquo;t want to go to Rajasthan. My father didn&rsquo;t want to go to<br>Rajasthan; Fairly certain even Rajasthanis&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t want to be in Rajasthan. Not<br>my mother though, she loved it there. That&rsquo;s where she&rsquo;s from, and that&rsquo;s where<br>she met daddy dear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But alas, my sweet father didn&rsquo;t have it in him to say no to my mother. Especially<br>not now that they&rsquo;ve finally got back together. He wouldn&rsquo;t want to blemish<br>their newly reawakened love. She said wanted to visit the place where the first<br>met, which is cool and all, but </span><span class="c2 c5">damn</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;why&rsquo;d they have to meet there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know where&rsquo;s a nice place to meet someone for the first time? Kerala! A<br>houseboat tenderly rocking in the middle of a calm, serene lake, green greenery<br>in the horizon; reading those WEBTOONs I had been saving up for a month whilst<br>floating on an inflatable bed. Maybe going for a swim later, wrestling with my<br>sister in the waters. Oh such fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But noo, my parents would rather be driving around in taxis with barely functioning<br>ACs just to go watch to some rusty daggers in a museum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the first summer in a long, long time that we&#39;d all be together. 12 years,<br>to be precise. That was when my parents divorced. I stayed with my father, and<br>my sister Sera, with my mother. We&#39;d barely saw each other, my sister and I,<br>but I&#39;d still love her company whenever we did end up meeting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I suppose I ought to be happy that we were all back together, and I was, really.<br>It&#39;s just, I&#39;d be happier if we were going to Kerala instead, you know?&#x1f602;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, I guess I shouldn&#39;t have pestered them so much, trying to change their mind.<br>Sprinkling some sand in the rice we were having for lunch, to give them a taste<br>(literally&#x1f602;) of what awaited us in Rajasthan was<br>definitely going a bit too far. :P</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyhow, I was rewarded for my efforts my being banned to discuss our trip ka<br>destination. I should&#39;ve expected this I guess &#x1f61d;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so I was sitting on the sofa, watching Big Boss, having no knowledge of where we<br>were heading off to the day after, when the doorbell rang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My sister suddenly emerged from her room and ran to the door with a smile on her<br>face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gir jayegi baba, aaram se&quot;, I yelled after her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kaam kar na apna&quot;, she seemed unnaturally excited.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She came back a few minutes later, with a Myntra ka parcel in her hand. Oh, new clothes. &#x1f61d;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is it for the trip?&quot; I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Maybe.&quot; She turned, holding the parcel in her chest and swinging back and forth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Will you just tell me where we&#39;re going?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Nah&quot;, she grinned, &quot;bahut shauk tha na Rajasthan demonstrate karneka, ab bhugad.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Tell me yaar, just tell me.&quot;, I turned to face her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Will you fold up all the clothes in my room?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&#39;d been trying on a bunch of clothes, trying to decide what to pack. Her room was a mess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Bhak be, I&#39;ll just check Dad ka laptop for emails about hotel reservations.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She knew it would be hard for me to get my hands his laptop at this time, and so<br>was unfazed, and replied &quot;Kar le na fold, I&#39;ll tell you riight<br>away.&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was being sweet and pouty, an annoying skill she&#39;s developed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just looked at her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She continued in a sing song voice, &quot;bechara John, doesn&#39;t even know where<br>he&#39;s going.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, okay then.&quot;, she said nonchalantly, shrugging her shoulders, holding her<br>lower lip out, and starting to walk away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No wait!&quot; damn, she had grown cuter, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Atta-boy!&quot;, she exclaimed, grinning like a hyena. Walking over and grabbing me by the arms, she dragged me to her room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell me first. Only then will I help. HELP, mind you. I am not doing it all of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell?&rdquo;, she said, smirking, &ldquo;Why tell when I can show? Now come on, don&rsquo;t be shy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Entering her room, I instantly regretted my decision. Her room looked like it had been hit by a tornado coming straight from an upstate thrift store. Ugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I picked a top up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What planet is this from?&rdquo; I asked, half whispering. How would this even fold? She paid no heed to me though, and ran off to her bathroom with her parcel, still<br>just as gleeful as before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you wear normal stuff, huh?&rdquo; I shouted after her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She replied by slamming her door. &#x1f602;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh well, such is life. I got down to business.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*****************************************************************</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Scroll. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Double tap, like.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Scroll.. scroll.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Double tap, like.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Scroll..</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gasped and froze.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had read somewhere, being rendered unable to speak as a reaction to a saddening revelation or observation, be described as having their heart caught in their throat. It seemed fitting. Almost as if it were true. I had experienced this myself on numerous occasions, it really felt like there was something there. &#x1f61d;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was a quite similar experience, this; me seeing </span><span class="c2 c5">him </span><span class="c2">in a post with </span><span class="c2 c5">her. </span><span class="c0">Except, it was almost as if my heart was caught in my brain. I didn&#39;t know what to think. No.. I couldn&#39;t think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I locked my phone and put it to sleep. And then, tried putting myself to sleep. It wouldn&#39;t be as easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We had been talking for 3-4 months now, it had been going so well. I was in bliss &#x1f606;. He was a friend of a friend. We met a few times, I didn&#39;t really think much of him. He was good looking, with a naturally well built bod, maybe even handsome. But not overtly so, and so I didn&#39;t think much of him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we kept meeting, for some reason or the other, and he grew on me. It wasn&#39;t that he was exceptionally witty or funny or charming, nor was it that he was very sweet, or too kind. No, he was merely witty and funny or charming enough to not be boring, and just sweet or kind enough to not come off as snobbish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mostly what attracted me to him was that we seemed to be similar, not personality wise or character wise, but ideologically&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#x1f602;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know, I know, it doesn&#39;t really make a lot of sense. But we did tend to agree on, well, our outlook on life &#x1f61b;, and it somehow seemed attractive. If it makes no sense to you, well nevermind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Regardless, it was primarily the fact that he had no overt flaws, and that </span><span class="c2 c5">us </span><span class="c0">was so easily possible, that attracted me to him. He seemed to like me, and used to flirt and well, I had just felt good enough that I wanted more of it &#x1f61d;.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I burrowed my face into my pillow, trying to escape any more thoughts of him.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeaaah&hellip; didn&#39;t work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#x1f602;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">That bitch though.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I burrowed my face in deeper.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Honestly, that bitch though, </span><span class="c2">I thought, with her stupid slender waist, perfect model like chest; not too big, but not too small, and always, </span><span class="c2 c5">always</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the perfect amount of cleavage. It didn&#39;t matter what she wore, a tank top, a salwar; she always seemed to be able to show just enough that it seemed elegant, and just enough that it was sexy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">She pissed me off. </span><span class="c0">Don&#39;t get me wrong, I didn&#39;t really care so much about him, and while I might not be as slim, I was still nothing to scoff at. My body still got plenty of attention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, I could never show off such cleavage, mine were too big for that; or wear as tight tees&hellip; my tummy would show &#x1f602;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
