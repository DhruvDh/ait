I didn&rsquo;t want to spend 5 days in old, crocked up museums or withered castles; sweating buckets in the heat and getting sand stuck in my boxers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c4">My sister didn&rsquo;t want to go to Rajasthan. My father didn&rsquo;t want to go to Rajasthan; </span><span class="c3">Fairly certain </span><span class="c1">even Rajasthanis&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t want to be in Rajasthan. Not my mother though, she loved it there. That&rsquo;s where she&rsquo;s from, and that&rsquo;s where she met daddy dear.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c4">But alas, my sweet father didn&rsquo;t have it in him to say no to my mother. Especially not now that they&rsquo;ve finally got back together. He wouldn&rsquo;t want to blemish their newly reawakene</span><span class="c3">d love</span><span class="c3 c4">. She said wanted to visit the place where the first met, which is cool and all, but </span><span class="c0">damn</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;why&rsquo;d they have to meet there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You know where&rsquo;s a nice place to meet someone for the first time? Kerala! A houseboat tenderly rocking in the middle of a calm, serene lake, green greenery in the horizon; reading those WEBTOONs I had been saving up for a month whilst floating on an inflatable bed. Maybe going for a swim later, wrestling with my sister in the waters. Oh such fun.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c4">But noo, my parents would rather be driving around in taxis with barely functioning ACs just to go watch to some rusty daggers in </span><span class="c3">a </span><span class="c1">museum.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the first summer in a long, long time that we&#39;d all be together. 12 years, to be precise. That was when my parents divorced. I stayed with my father, and my sister Sera, with my mother. We&#39;d barely saw each other, my sister and I, but I&#39;d still love her company whenever we did end up meeting.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c3 c4">I suppose I </span><span class="c3">ought</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to be happy that we were all back together, and I was, really. It&#39;s just, I&#39;d be happier if we were going to Kerala instead, you know?&#x1f602;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Still, I guess I shouldn&#39;t have pestered them so much, trying to change their mind. Sprinkling some sand in the rice we were having for lunch, to give them a taste (literally&#x1f602;) of what awaited us in Rajasthan was definitely going a bit too far. :P</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Anyhow, I was rewarded for my efforts my being banned to discuss our trip ka destination. I should&#39;ve expected this I guess&#x1f61d;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so I was sitting on the sofa, watching Big Boss, having no knowledge of where we were heading off to the day after, when the doorbell rang.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My sister suddenly emerged from her room and ran to the door with a smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Gir jayegi baba, aaram se&quot;, I yelled after her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Kaam kar na apna&quot;, she seemed unnaturally excited. She came back a few minutes later, with a Myntra ka parcel in her hand. Oh, new clothes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Is it for the trip?&quot; I asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Maybe.&quot; She turned, holding the parcel in her chest and swinging back and forth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Will you just tell me where we&#39;re going?&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Nah&quot;, she grinned, &quot;bahut shauk tha na Rajasthan demonstrate karneka, ab bhugad.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Tell me yaar, just tell me.&quot;, I turned to face her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Will you fold up all the clothes in my room?&quot; She&#39;d been trying on a bunch of clothes, trying to decide what to pack. Her room was a mess.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Bhak be, I&#39;ll just check Dad ka laptop for emails about hotel reservations&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She knew it would be hard for me to get my hands his laptop at this time, and so was unfazed, and replied &quot;Kar le na fold, I&#39;ll tell you riight away&quot;. She was being sweet and pouty, an annoying skill she&#39;s developed. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I just looked at her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She continued in a sing song voice, &quot;bechara John, doesn&#39;t even know where he&#39;s going&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;No.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, okay then.&quot;, she said nonchalantly, shrugging her shoulders, holding her lower lip out, and starting to walk away.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c4 c5"></span></p></body></html>
